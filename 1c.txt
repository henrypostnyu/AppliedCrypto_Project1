Let an affine cipher be defined by the equiation C = (A * p + b) modulo m
Let C, A, p, b, m be elements of Z (the set of integers)
Where p corresponds to the order of the corresponding integer for a A letter (e.g. A = 0, B = 1, etc), and C is integer corresponding to the
encrypted letter.

We are given the letter 'T' is encrypted to 'H' and 'O' to 'E', we also know that m = 26 because the affine cipher uses every letter
of the alphabet. Therefore we know:

19 -> 7, 14 -> 4

Yielding the following equations:

7 = (19A + b) mod 26
and
4 = (14A + b) mod 26

Because addition and multiplication are well-defined under modulus operation, we know the following:

[a]m + [b]m = [a+b]m 
and
[a]m * [b]m = [ab]m 

where [a] and [b] are the representative congruence classes, containing the set of all integers x,y satisfying the equation 
x mod m = a and y mod m = b.

This mathematical property allows us to rearrange the equations as follows to solve for A. 

7 - 4 = [(19A + b) mod 26] - [(14A + b) mod 26]
3 = 19A mod 26 - 15A mod 26
3 = 5A mod 26

For the affine cipher to be able to both encrypt and decrypt, the modulo multiplicative inverse must exist. This occurs when 
A and m and relatively prime (the only factor they have in common is 1). Therefore, we know the only possible values of A are:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25.

The value of A can be obtained by trying each of these values until we satisfy:

3 = 5A mod 26

finding A = 11.  

With A = 11, we can now solve for b using the encryption equations for either of the known values

4 = (14 * 11 + b) mod 26
4 = (154) mod 26 + b mod 26
4 = 24 + b mod 26
b = 6


With the value of A and b known, there are two options to decrypt the message. You can either using C = 11p + 6 to encrypt 0 - 25, yielding 
the following key: GRCNYJUFQBMXITEPALWHSDOZKV, where:

G = A
R = B
C = C
...
Z = X
K = Y
V = Z

Alternatively, now that we know the value of A, we can calculate the modulo multiplicative inverse, or in mathematical terms, a 
value A' (said A-prime, or A-inverse) such at (A * A') mod 26  = 1. We can derive the following formula for decryption:

P = [A' * (c - b)] mod m

for example, using our known values, we can verify:

[19 * (4 - 6)] mod 26 = 14
[19 * (7 - 6)] mod 26 = 19
where 4 is the integer representation of E, the ciphertext of plaintext O. 

Mapping the ciphertext according to A = 0, B = 1, etc. yeilds the following numeric cipher:
Q  - J - K  - E - S  - R  - E - O  - G - H - G - X  - X  - R  - E - O  - X  - E  - O 

16 - 9 - 10 - 4 - 18 - 17 - 4 - 14 - 6 - 7 - 6 - 23 - 23 - 17 - 4 - 14 - 23 - 4 - 14 

plugging into our formula yields:
[19 * (16 - 6)] mod 26 = 8 = I 
[19 * (9 - 6)] mod 26 = 15 = F
...
[19 * (14 - 6)] mod 26 = 22 = W
